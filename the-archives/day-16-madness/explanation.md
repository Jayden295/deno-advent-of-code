# Yes, i took around two days to solve that

well 1 and a half days since i also have school but this WAS HELL

I WAS STUCK ON THE PART 2 FOR A WHILE
THESE WERE MY PREVIOUS ATTEMPTS AT DOING IT

i suceeded in the end by bringing an innovative process :tm: called:
ig ill just restart the whole thing after thinking a bit on how to do it

originally i updated the future things from like when we will turn
but there were some edge cases

awful explanation i know, just be aware there were odd edge cases with the old
implementation (which was fine if you didnt have to find every single possible path
but thats what part 2 is about)

i  might be going insane and im running out of time

two puzzles behind...
